### Catching the Bad Guys with Satellites and AI

*UC Berkeley MIDS Capstone Project - Fighting trafficking one pixel at a time*

---

## 🎯 What's This All About?

**The Problem**: Bad actors are smuggling people, drugs, and other illegal stuff across oceans and remote coastlines where nobody's watching.

**Our Solution**: Use satellite images + smart AI to spot suspicious boats and activities. Think of it as a digital watchtower that never sleeps! 

**The Twist**: We built this with privacy first - no creepy surveillance, just helping the good guys catch the bad guys.

## 🚀 Cool Features

Our web app lets analysts:
- 📤 **Upload satellite photos** and run AI detection
- 🗺️ **Interactive maps** showing risky areas and suspicious boats  
- 📊 **Risk scores** - how suspicious is this location?
- 📈 **Time analysis** - what changed between last week and this week?
- 📄 **Generate reports** for the people who need to know
- 🔒 **Privacy built-in** - everything stays anonymous and aggregated

## 🛠️ Quick Start Guide

### What You Need First
- **Python 3.8+** (for the AI stuff)
- **Node.js 16+** (for the web app)
- **Git** (to download the code)

### 1️⃣ Get the Code
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd eyes-in-sky
```

### 2️⃣ Set Up the AI Backend (Python)

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
# Create a virtual environment (like a clean room for Python)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install all the AI libraries
pip install -r server/requirements.txt
```

**Windows:**
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r server/requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Set Up the Web App (React)

**Don't have Node.js?** Get it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) 

```bash
# Go to the web app folder
cd client

# Install all the web stuff
npm install

# Go back to main folder
cd ..
```

### 4️⃣ Fire It Up! 🔥

**Start the AI server:**
```bash
# Make sure Python environment is active
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

cd server
python app.py
```
*Your AI server will run on http://localhost:5000*

**Start the web app (in a new terminal):**
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```
*Your web app will run on http://localhost:5173*

## 🧠 The AI Magic Behind the Scenes

We use multiple AI techniques to catch suspicious activity:

### 🔍 **Ship Detection**
- Spots boats in satellite images, even tiny ones
- Works in all weather (thanks to radar satellites!)

### 📡 **Tracking Analysis** 
- Notices when boats "go dark" (turn off GPS)
- Flags weird routes and suspicious meetups

### 🌙 **Night Activity**
- Detects unusual lights on beaches at night
- Catches secret launches under cover of darkness

### 📷 **Change Detection**
- Compares "before" and "after" satellite photos
- Spots new boat ramps or camps that shouldn't be there

### 🎯 **Smart Risk Scoring**
- Combines all the evidence into a single risk score
- Helps analysts focus on the most suspicious stuff first

## 🔒 Privacy First (This is Important!)

We're not building Big Brother! Here's how we keep it ethical:

- ✅ **No personal info** - we don't track individuals
- ✅ **Blurry by design** - all locations are fuzzy (100-500m areas)
- ✅ **Human oversight** - real people verify everything before action
- ✅ **Event-focused** - we flag "something happened here" not "person X did Y"

## 🚧 Troubleshooting

**🔧 Common Fixes:**

**"Port already in use"**
- Someone else is using that port. Try `npm run dev -- --port 3001`

**"Module not found"**  
- Check your virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`

**"Node.js issues"**
- Try: `npm cache clean --force` then `npm install`

**"Python environment problems"**
- Delete `.venv` folder and start over with step 2

## 📚 The Bigger Picture

**By the numbers:**
- 50+ million people in modern slavery worldwide
- $236 billion generated by forced labor annually
- $1.5+ trillion in trafficking and counterfeiting

**Our impact**: Even small improvements in detection can save lives and disrupt criminal networks.
